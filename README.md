# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

## Project Overview

This project is a learning exercise designed to enhance my skills in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It involves creating a Rock-Paper-Scissors game with various interactive and visual features. The project incorporates several advanced elements such as confetti effects, button disabling, and user feedback.

## Features

- **Basic Game Functionality**: Play Rock-Paper-Scissors against the computer.
- **Confetti Animation**: A confetti effect is displayed when the user wins, using a confetti script.
- **Dynamic Button States**: Buttons are disabled and re-enabled after a delay to prevent multiple clicks.
- **Customizable Game Rules**: Future plans include allowing users to choose the number of rounds (best of 1, 3, or 5) and adding more interactive animations.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the game and interface.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout, including responsive design and button animations.
